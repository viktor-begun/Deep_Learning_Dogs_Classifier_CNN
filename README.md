# Dogs_Classifier_CNN
Task: build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will give an estimate of the dogâ€™s breed.  The second project of the Deep Learning Nanodegree Program from Udacity, see https://www.udacity.com/

The solution is in the file `dog_app_my_solution.ipynb`.
The two other files `test_net.ipynb` and `test_models.ipynb` are the help files to check performance of different networks and of the final model pre-trained to a different level of accuracy.
